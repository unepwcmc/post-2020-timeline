‘Mapping our conservation future’ scoping workshop,06/06/2017,06/06/2017,"Cambridge, UK",UNEP-WCMC,"The ‘Mapping our conservation future’ scoping workshop on 6th June 2017 was convened by UNEP-WCMC and focused on scaling up ambition for area-based conservation. It brought together an international collection of biodiversity-related institutions to discuss three key questions: 1. How can we provide meaningful data on biodiversity at a scale needed for decision making? 2. What is needed for the biodiversity community to speak with one voice on biodiversity prioritization - i.e. where is important to focus conservation efforts? 3. How can we assess where important biodiversity is, and is not, being effectively managed?",This worshop focused on the current state of Aichi Target 11 and how this could be followed up post-2020.,A workshop report is available on request.,Area-based conservation,,3

It aims to help build global momentum for the Promise of Sydney to scale up conservation, using protected areas as the key conservation tool. Furthermore, it aims to ensure that, in 2020, new global conservation targets for spatial conservation are set that would be meaningful for achieving the CBD's basic purpose, which is the conservation of biological diversity and the halting of biodiversity loss.",,Area-based conservation,,2
